        <p>Create customized jewelry that reflects the style she has built through the years, and pair it with a box. While this page deals with creative and unusual 50th birthday ideas for women, based around group activities and experiences, you can also check out my main page of 50th birthday party ideas (for women and men!) which contains lots of creative ideas for throwing a party at home—including party themes, countdown ideas, invitations, food &amp; drink, decorations, gifts, and ways to include. Make this milestone birthday special with beer and wine gifts, exciting experiences, hampers and much more. Steer clear of clichés and choose something unique and thoughtful that will help her celebrate the half century she’s enjoyed and look forward to the decades to come, like jewelry to wish by or a book of affirmations to live by. This is a turning point in her life.</p>
