        <p>How much for bat mitzvah gift? This means a family of two adults and two children may give between $180 and $360 or more. For example, if you were going to give a present of $100 for that birthday, you would want to give something in the neighborhood of $150, but in a multiple of eighteen, so. If you are a family you can share a present with the parents or the brothers, so the amount of money you give can be lower. All in all, it is what you are comfortable gifting.</p>
