        <p>Amazon refunded to gift card instead of credit card. Status not open for further replies. I don&#039;t want to buy 650$ at target. Instant refunds are either refunded to your credit card or given to you as an amazon uk gift card balance, depending on what you select. Sorry, you need to call us.</p>
