        <p>Guests often gift money in increments of $18, a symbol of “chai,” in jewish tradition, which means “life.”. Making a donation in honor of the bar or bat mitzvah is a meaningful way to incorporate the jewish (and universal) value of helping those in need. It is also completely acceptable to round to normal. With this in mind, $180 (10×18), $324 (18×18, so extra credit here!), and $360 (20×18) seem to be the best amounts for bar mitzvah gifts if you decide not to give a real present. You can never go wrong with money presents, in jewish tradition if you’re going to give money, a meaningful number is 18 because in hebrew it has the same numerical value as the word chai,meaning “ life”.</p>
